<!--
    The token item id is 900000
    it has an entry in ItemTemplate.xml server side and ItemData/ItemData-00000.xml client side
    here we can change the basic item information like sale value etc.
-->

<!--
    Next we have an entry in VillagerData/VillagerMenuItem.xml (server side) which ties the item id to a medal id
    for this I made the medal id the same as the item id.
-->
<VillagerMenuItem itemTemplateId="900000" type="MedalStore" id="900000" />

<!--
    Next we have BuyMenuList.xml (server side), this sets the categories for the token shop.
    We set the id for <Menu> to our medal id (900000) and each category (<ItemList>) has it's own id.
    I made the id's increment by 1 from the medal id: 900001, 900002, etc for each category.
    The stringed option point to a string in StrSheet_Npc (client side) that holds the names of the shop and categories.
    I will give an example for StrSheet_Npc later in this file.
-->
<Menu id="900000" desc="Eternity Token" stringId="900000">
    <ItemList id="900001" stringed="900001" />
    <ItemList id="900002" stringed="900002" />
</Menu>

<!--
    Next we have BuyList.xml (server side) here we put the items contained in each category.
    Each <List> will have in id that corresponds to the category id we set in the previous file (900001 for example)
    and it needs our medal item id too (900000).
    This example has an item entry for Tier 4 Feedstock, and Masterwork Alkahest.
    I don't know what priceRevision does but everything has it set to 1 so we will do the same.
-->
<List id="900001" desc="Eternity Token (Materials)" NeedMedalItemId="900000"> 	
    <Item priceRevision="1" itemId="94104" />
    <Item priceRevision="1" itemId="21351" />
</List>

<!-- To add a category you simply make an <ItemList> entry within our <Menu> entry in BuyMenuList.xml and a <List> entry in BuyList.xml -->

<!--
    Next we have ItemMedalExchange.xml (server side) this sets the price of each item.
    Here we put the item id for one of our items (94104 / Tier 4 feedstock in this example) at a cost of 1 token.
    and we also put the medal item id (900000).
    Every item must have an ItemMedalExchange entry or the server will crash.
-->
<Exchange itemId="94104" buyPriceMedal="1" medalItemId="900000" />

<!--
    Lastly we have StrSheet_Npc/StrSheet_Npc-00000.xml
    This holds the strings for our token shop
    Here I put the string id's the same as our category id's to keep things simple
    900000+ is available so I figured why not.
    When you add a new category make sure to make an entry here with the name of it :)
-->
<String id="900000" string="Eternity Token" />
<String id="900001" string="Materials" />
<String id="900002" string="Costumes" />

<!-- The item name and tooltip is in StrSheet_Item/StrSheet_Item-00000.xml client side -->
